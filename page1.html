                            Instructions need to be <b>coherent</b> to allow a person or computer to preform the <b>correct steps</b> when following an algorithm.
                            Inputs of an algorithm have to be <b>relevent</b> or the algorithm won't be able to preform the logical steps to yeild the correct solution.</p>

                            Jane wants to eat a cheese sandwich. She does this by taking a slice of chesse, inserting it between two slices of bread and cutting her sandwich diagonally.
                            Jane asks her friend Alice
                            to make her a cheese sandwich. Alice has never made a cheese sandwich before and so asks Jane for instructions.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            "Get two slices of bread and one slice of cheese"
                            <br> "Put the slice of cheese between the two slices of bread"
                            <br> "Finally slice the sandwich in half diagonally"
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            In this example, <b>the two slices of bread and slice of cheese are the inputs</b>, the <b>operations</b> involved were <b>
                                putting the slice of cheese between the two slices of bread
                                and slicing the sandwich in half diagonally
                            </b> and the <b>output</b> from this algorithm is <b>Janes version of a cheese sandwich</b>. Something to keep in mind is that many algorithms
                            can produce the same result by using different <b>inputs and processes/ operations</b> (like if the input was an already prepared cheese sandwich and the process carried out was just slicing it diagonally).
                            Another thing to note is the <b>Jane</b> was not very specific about how to cut the sandwich. This is because she infers that Alice already has <b>assumed knowledge</b> of how to cut
                            a sandwich in half, how diagonal she wanted the sandwich to be cut, what she would need to cut the sandwich, etc. One last thing to mention is that what Jane sees as a "Cheese Sandwich" will not
                            always correlate to somebody else's version of a cheese sandwich. You might make a cheese sandwich completely different to how Jane makes hers.

                            A machine takes integers, multiplies them by 5 and outputs the result.

                            <br>
                            In this example, the integers are the input, the multiplication by 5 is the operation and the result of the multiplication is the output.
                            You wouldn't input a string or character as the the input doesn't match the input required and you can't multiply words or letters.

                            Here we have data items (there may be names associated with the <p ></p><b>∙</b> items in
                            the picture) that have connections between them. Sometimes these connections
                            only work in one direction, and sometimes they go both ways. There are many
                            examples of this kind, and maybe the most natural one is that of some kind of map,
                            for example for a transport system, but these might also be the description for moves in a game. Or, for example, the first picture might describe which people in
                            a small group know each other, and the second might describe whether a person
                            likes another. The possibilities are endless.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            We need to make formal what we mean by these pictures in such a way that
                            we are able to use them in an algorithm. We say that a graph has
                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li> <b>nodes</b>, which are indicated as ∙ in the picture and</li>
                            <li> <b>edges</b>, which are the connections between the nodes.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>
                            Our pictures suggest that we can treat all the nodes as the same somehow
                            since they are all marked by ∙, but any description of a graph will have to have
                            distinct names for the nodes, and we find it useful to think of them as forming a
                            set.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            We may have even more data to include in our picture, and we talk about that
                            after looking at formal definitions.

                          We have to make a distinction between the situation where the edges are directed
                          and that where they work both ways.
                          If there is an edge from a node <b><em>X</em></b> to a node <b><em>Y</em></b> we say that <b> <em>x</em> is a direct neighbour
                          of <em>y</em></b>.

                          <p>In the above definition, we say that the edges in <b><em>E</em></b> are pairs of nodes (via
                            E ⊆ ( N x N)) and we exclude edges from a node to itself (via ∖{(n, n) | n ∈ N}).
                            Based on this definition, the following defines a directed graph:
                          </p>

                          <div class="row">

                            <div class="col-6">
                              <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;"><em>E = {(a, b), (b, a), (b, c) , (c, b), (d, a), (d, b)}</em></p>
                            </div>
                          </div>

                          <p>We may picture this graph as shown in Figure 2.
                            The example should make it clear that we interpret an edge of the form <em>(x, y)</em>
                            as a connection from <b><em>x</em></b> to <b><em>y</em></b>.
                            This leaves us with explaining why we are excluding edges of the form <em>(n, n)</em>
                            where <em>n ∈ N</em>. This would be an edge that goes from a node to itself</p>

                          <p>
                            This is not allowed according to our definition. If we wanted this to be a feature
                            we would have to talk about a directed graph with loops but we will not use those
                            in this course unit.

                            <p>Also note that by saying that the set of edges forms a subset of the set <em>N × N</em>
                              we ensure that there is at most one edge from a node <em>x</em> to a node <em>y</em>.</p>
                            
                            <p>There may be reasons you would like to allow there to be more than one edge,
                              in which case we would speak of a (directed) graph with multi-edges. For this
                              we need to change the formal definition, but we will not be concerned with that
                              possibility in this unit so we do not look into the details.</p>
                          </p>

                          <h5 id = 'item-2-3'>Undirected graphs</h5>
                          <p>What is the difference between a directed and an undirected graph? We think of
                            all the connections as working both ways, but what does that mean for our formal
                            definition?
                          </p>
                          <p>There are two solutions one might adopt here. We might either still use a set
                            <em>E ⊆ N × N</em> to give the edges, but demand that <em>(x, y) ∈ E</em> implies <em>(y, x) ∈ E</em>, to
                            ensure that all edges go both ways. But that would make the set <em>E</em> twice as big as
                            it needs to be.
                          </p>

                          <p>Instead we use 2-element subsets of <em>N</em> to describe the edges of our graph,
                            making use of one of the features of sets, namely that the order of elements does
                            not matter.</p>

                            Again we forbid loops by not allowing one-element sets of the form {x} to
                            define an edge (which would have to be from x to itself). We again do not allow
                            multi-edges in our definition since we demand that all the edges form a set, which
                            rules out duplicates. We may now consider the graph

                          <h5 id="item-4-1">Introduction</h5>
                          <p>Some problems might not be easier to solve via an iterative method, iterate just mean repeat an action 
                            like how you continually move your mouth whilst you eat anyway, however iteration may not always be the best way to go about solving a problem 
                            this is due to how some data structures work such as a binary trees</p>
                          <h4 id="item-4-2">Definitions</h4>
                          <p>Recursion: This the process by which a algorithm may call itself again and again until a condition is met e.g., does the number of items 
                            in the list equal zero if not input the list of items into the algorithm again. <br>
                            <p>Stack: this a data structure which the first element to be added will be the last one to be called<br>
                          <h4 id="item-4-3">How recursion works:</h4>
                          <p>
                              Recursive algoithm is called with given input<br>
                              Does input satsify the breaking condition
                              <ol>
                              <ul>
                                  <li>it doesnt satisfy the breaking condtion also known as base case meaning the recursive algorithm calls itself again<br></li>
                                  <ol>It must also keep track of all values on that specific call of the algorithm<br>
                                  Add variables, data structures etc. to stack,<br>
                                  Recursive algotithm calls itself again <br></ol>
                                  
                              </ul>
                              <ul>
                               <li>if it does satisfy the breaking condtion then: <br></li> 
                               <ul> then the recusion algoraithm stops calling itself<br>
                                  then for every time it has recalled itself it will output or reuse values on the highest layer of the stack and 
                                  input those into that of the stack below it until the stack is empty<br></ol>
                                 
                              </ul>

                              </ol>
